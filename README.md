# My Interactive Sales Dashboard Project Involving a Mock Business Request, Brief Analysis, and a Visualization if Viewer Doesn't Have Power BI. 

<h2>Observations</h2>

* June historically has been the most profitable month.
* July historically has been consistently underperforming.
* Road bikes were the best selling bikes monthly for all of 2020, 2021, and the first quarter of 2023.
* The more the budget, the less volatile the sales to budget relationship gets year-over-year.
* Throughout 2020-2022, 9 out of 10 of the top 10 customers buy most of their bikes during spring and summer.
* There's a substantial discrepancy between the sales of best selling products and the least popular ones.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

* Get rid of sub categories that underperform like locks, pedals, wheels, chains, brakes etc.
* Reduce advertising to underperforming cities/regions like Clarkston, Chehalis, Central Valley, Cedar Park and focus those resources on profitable markets/cities like London, Paris, Warrnambool, and Bellflower.
* For now, bike sales should still be a priority, bike sales made up ~94% of all sales in 2022.
* For the situation of June historically being a very profitable month for bikes but July historically being the least profitable, I would approach this problem in a few ways. I would recommend an experiment of lowering the budget for July to determine if the sales relate to the budget spend or external factors. Or analyze competitors to determine if they allocated more resources towards marketing than us during July. Or review how differently June’s budget is channeled compared to July’s. 
* Considering the seasonal pattern of bike sales in general, I believe that customers buy the most bikes before summer, during summer, and during the holidays (Christmas). There should be more of an incentive to raise budgets during these periods.
* We should also consider focusing efforts on areas where it’s common to travel on bike, mountainous areas (since mountain bikes are one of our best sellers), and areas where bike-friendly infrastructure is common.

Showcases the discrepancy in sales between the top 3 best selling products and the rest. Bike sales made up ~96.6% of all sales from 2020 to 2022. Courses of action would be to either concentrate resources on bike sales or diversify marketing strategies to highlight the benefits of other products.

Example of an underperforming city like Clarkston in comparison to a profitable city like London. Similar to the discrepancy in sales of the top and lowest performing products, we also need to concentrate our resources to regions that have a higher return.
